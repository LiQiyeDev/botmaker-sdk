 * threading a {@link CaptureSource} through every call.
 *
 * <p>On first use the current source initialises to the <strong>project default source</strong> (as
 * configured in Studio and baked into the generated bot), falling back to the whole {@link Desktop}
 * when none is configured. Override it at runtime with {@link #set(CaptureSource)} — for example to
 * point the whole bot at a game {@link Window} once, up front — and every subsequent no-source call
 * follows until it is changed again.
 *
 * <p>Methods that <em>do</em> take an explicit {@link CaptureSource} always use that argument and
 * ignore this global; the global only fills in the no-source overloads.
