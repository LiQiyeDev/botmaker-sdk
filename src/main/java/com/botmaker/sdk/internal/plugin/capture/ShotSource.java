 * Where {@link ScreenOverlay} gets its pixels — the one thing the overlay needs from whoever knows what a

 * <p><b>Two methods, and that is the measured size of the coupling.</b> A survey of the 1,324-line service
 * this was split out of found exactly two places where the overlay flow touched a capture target: resolving
 * which pixels to grab, and naming the window a captured template came from. Everything else — the screen
 * chooser, the rubber-band surfaces, the magnifier, the crop arithmetic, the blank-frame warning — was
 * already target-free.
 *
 * <p>{@link DesktopSource} is the host's only implementation, and since 2026-08-31 the only one here at all:
 * the target-resolving source went to the SDK plugin with the capture targets themselves. The interface
 * survives the departure rather than being inlined, because two methods is also the measured size of what a
 * different source would have to supply — and the overlay proving it needs nothing more than this is what
 * made the move possible.
