# ROADMAP

A running history of features and refactors for future Claude Code sessions. **Append here whenever
you add a feature or refactor** (this is required — see `CLAUDE.md` › Planning).

Format: newest first. Each dated entry has a **Done** list (what shipped) and, when relevant, updates
to **Deferred / next** (intentionally left for later, with enough context to pick up cold).

## 2026-06-30 — Linux click support

**Done**
- **Linux click works.** `api.interaction.Mouse.click` now routes through
  `internal/capture/core/NativeControllerFactory.get()` instead of calling the Windows-only
  `internal/capture/Clicker` (JNA `User32`) directly. This fixes
  `UnsatisfiedLinkError: Unable to load library 'user32'` on Linux, which surfaced whenever a click
  actually fired (i.e. when `ImageFinder` found the template on screen). Windows path is unchanged
  (factory → `WindowsController` → `Clicker` → `User32 PostMessage`).
- **Multi-monitor coordinates fixed.** Added `api.capture.Screen.captureOrigin()` (the virtual-screen
  origin from `ScreenCapture.getVirtualScreenBounds()`). `ImageFinder.find/findAll` and
  `ImageState.findWhichAreVisibleDetailed` now add this origin to match coordinates, so reported
  points are **absolute** screen coordinates. Previously they were image-local, so clicks landed off
  by the virtual origin whenever a monitor was placed left/above the primary (negative origin).
  Note: `ImageFinder.find/findAll` now return absolute coords (corrected contract).
- **Cursor save/restore on Linux click (X11 only).** `LinuxController.postLeftClickScreen` reads the
  pre-click pointer via X11 `XQueryPointer` (added the binding in `linux/X11.java`) against the
  default root window — same coordinate space as `XTestFakeMotionEvent` — and warps back after the
  click. Gated on `WAYLAND_DISPLAY == null`; skipped under Wayland (see below).

**Deferred / next**
- **Click without disturbing the cursor on native Wayland.** Under native Wayland the JVM is an
  XWayland client: it can *write* the pointer (warp/click via XTest) but **cannot read** the global
  cursor position, so save/restore is impossible there (it would teleport the cursor to a stale
  constant). Current interim: on Wayland we skip restore and leave the cursor on the click target.
  Proper fix: implement input injection via the **xdg-desktop-portal RemoteDesktop** interface
  (libei / PipeWire) — this is also what raises the one-time "allow control of pointer/keyboard"
  prompt. Alternative (weaker): window-relative motionless click via `XSendEvent`, but many apps
  ignore synthetic events and it can't reach native Wayland windows. Likely belongs alongside the
  capture backends as a new injection strategy.
- **GNOME/sway capture.** Add a portal/PipeWire `CaptureBackend` and wire into
  `CaptureBackend.select()` (noted in `CLAUDE.md` › Screen capture).
