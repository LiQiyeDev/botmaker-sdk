# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

The **BotMaker SDK** is the runtime library that user bots compile against. The sibling
**botmaker-studio** app (`../botmaker-studio`) generates user projects that depend on this SDK and
call its public `com.botmaker.sdk.api.*` facades. The SDK itself depends on **botmaker-shared**
(`../botmaker-shared`, cross-platform native window plumbing).

## Planning

For large changes, write the plan to a dedicated plan file before starting implementation, so work
can be resumed if a session is interrupted.

**Always update `ROADMAP.md` whenever you add a feature or refactor code** — append a dated entry
under "Done" (and add/adjust "Deferred / next" items as needed). It is the running history future
sessions rely on to understand what changed and what's intentionally left for later.

## Commands

```bash
mvn compile        # Build
mvn test           # Run tests (JUnit Jupiter)
mvn install        # Install to the local Maven repo (umbrella coordinate); for a generated bot to pick
                   #   up local changes use ./dev-install.sh instead (see Publishing › Local dev)
```

There are no `main`-method entry points. The module is a library: everything under `src/main` is
reachable from a generated bot, and everything that verifies it is JUnit under `src/test`. The five
manual harnesses that used to sit in `internal/` (and a hello-world `Main` that shipped in the
published jar) were deleted in 2026-07 — they were unreferenced, untested, and on every bot's
classpath. A new diagnostic goes in `src/test` with the JUnit the rest of the module uses.

## Publishing

The SDK is consumed by the **bot projects that Studio generates** (not by Studio itself), via JitPack as
`com.github.LiQiyeDev:botmaker-sdk:<tag>`. JitPack builds each git tag on demand and serves it under that
`com.github.LiQiyeDev` coordinate regardless of this pom's `groupId`/`version` (so the pom `version` is
cosmetic). **The maintainer owns the SDK → JitPack publish — don't push or publish the SDK yourself;**
releases are cut from the umbrella with `../release.sh`.

### Local dev (test SDK changes without pushing a tag)

> The old `dev-install.sh` script was removed and is **no longer needed**: this module's pom `groupId` is now
> `com.github.LiQiyeDev` (matching the coordinate JitPack serves), so a plain `mvn install` already lands the
> SDK at the coordinate a generated bot resolves. The whole `local-SNAPSHOT` / `-Dbotmaker.shared.version`
> dance the old script automated is obsolete.

A generated bot pins `com.github.LiQiyeDev:botmaker-sdk:<version>`, and the local `~/.m2` is checked before
JitPack. To make a bot pick up your local SDK changes, install both shared and the SDK to `~/.m2` at
`0.0.0-SNAPSHOT` in one shot from the umbrella root:

```bash
mvn -pl botmaker-sdk -am install     # builds+installs shared (-am) then the SDK, both at 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

`-am` ("also make") builds the SDK's reactor dependency `shared` first, so both land at `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
(the version every consumer defaults to via `${botmaker.shared.version}`), and the installed SDK depends on
that local shared. Re-run it after each SDK edit; a bot pinned to `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT` resolves the freshly
installed jar on its next classpath resolve.

You never type the version into Studio: it auto-lists locally-installed `*-SNAPSHOT` SDK builds (newest
first) at the top of the SDK version dropdown (New Project and Project ▸ Manage Libraries), labeled
`(local build)` and **preselected**, so a bot created in a dev-run Studio is pinned to `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
automatically. This affordance is gated on `AppVersion.isDevBuild()` (true only when there's no jar
manifest, i.e. an IDE/`javafx:run` launch), so packaged/released builds never surface your `~/.m2` snapshots
and their users only ever pick real released versions.

## Code Style

Prefer **functional OOP**: minimize mutable class fields to avoid state-related bugs. Favor immutable
values (`record`s like `MatchResult`, `RawMatch`, `Point`/`Rect`/`Size`) and pure transformations;
pass dependencies in via parameters rather than holding mutable fields or static/singleton state.
Keep side effects (screen capture, native library loading, process launching) at the edges. The
static facades (`ImageFinder`, `ImageClicker`, `ScreenCapture`, …) are stateless dispatchers.

## Architecture

### Public API vs internal plumbing

- **`com.botmaker.sdk.api.*`** is the API generated bots compile against, and **as of v1.1.0 it is under a
  compatibility contract** — the "freely breakable, no published bot consumes it yet" licence that governed
  everything up to v1.0.26 has ended. The full contract is
  **`../docs/refactor/21-api-compat.md`**; in one paragraph: real semver (additive → minor, breaking →
  major), and nothing is removed without one full minor release marked
  `@Deprecated(since = "x.y.z", forRemoval = true)` whose Javadoc `@deprecated` line names the replacement.
  A member added after 1.1.0 carries `@since`; the 1.1.0 surface itself carries none, because comparing two
  published jars already yields the exact per-version added/removed set and 818 identical tags would not.

  **A break must also ship its migration.** `src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/botmaker-sdk.yml` holds
  one OpenRewrite recipe per breaking release (`com.botmaker.sdk.UpgradeTo_2_0_0`, composed by
  `UpgradeToLatest`); `META-INF/botmaker/upgrade-notes.json` holds a sentence for each change no recipe can
  repair. Both ship inside the jar — `META-INF/rewrite/` is OpenRewrite's classpath-discovery slot — so a
  user migrates with one command and **no edit to their pom**:

  ```bash
  mvn org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:6.46.1:run \
      -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=com.github.LiQiyeDev:botmaker-sdk:v2.0.0 \
      -Drewrite.activeRecipes=com.botmaker.sdk.UpgradeTo_2_0_0
  ```

  Run it *before* bumping the pom (recipes come from the new jar, source must still type-attribute against
  the old one), and keep the plugin version pinned at **6.46.1 or newer**: 6.12.0 cannot read
  `META-INF/rewrite/` at all on JDK 24+.

  **The enforcement is japicmp against the previously published jar**, in the `api-check` profile
  (`pom.xml`). It is **off by default** — japicmp downloads the old jar, and `mvn -pl botmaker-sdk -am
  install` is the daily loop, which stays offline and fast. Run it by hand with:

  ```bash
  mvn -pl botmaker-sdk -Papi-check verify -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dbotmaker.api.oldVersion=v1.0.26
  python3 botmaker-sdk/tools/check-api-rules.py botmaker-sdk/target/japicmp/japicmp.xml
  ```

  `tools/check-api-rules.py` reads japicmp's XML and exits **0** (clean), **1** (breaking, but deprecated
  first *and* migratable — legal in a major release), **2** (something was removed that was never marked
  `forRemoval`) or **3** (something broke with no recipe and no upgrade note). 2 and 3 are wrong at *every*
  version, so `ci.yml` fails a PR on either; `../release.sh`'s `check_api_bump` owns the version question,
  because whether a break is *allowed* depends on the number being tagged and no PR build knows that. The
  script needs **PyYAML** to read the recipe file — `ci.yml` installs it explicitly so the rule cannot
  quietly stop being enforced.

  Two things that look like oversights and are not: japicmp's own `breakBuildOn*` flags are **off** (they
  would block every legitimate major-release PR), and the rule is Python rather than japicmp's
  `postAnalysisScript` **because japicmp 0.26.1's bundled Groovy cannot read Java 26 class files** while
  CI runs 21 — a rule that passes in CI and explodes locally is worse than no rule.

  It contains:
  - `api.vision` — `ImageFinder` (find + `exists` + the lambda control-flow `whileExists`/`ifExists`
    /`untilExists`), `ImageClicker`, `ImageWaiter`, `MatchResult`, `ImageTemplate`.
  - `api.vision.Tolerance` / `api.vision.MinPixels` — `Pixel`'s two precision knobs as value types rather
    than a bare `double`/`int`. Both are records with named constants (`Tolerance.TIGHT`,
    `MinPixels.DEFAULT`) and a validating `of(...)`. They are types because the numbers are unreadable
    alone — ΔE has no obvious scale, and `minPixels` is an *area* routinely misread as a width — and
    because it lets Studio dispatch their editors by **type** instead of by a `(method, argIndex)` table
    that would silently stop firing whenever `Pixel` gains an overload.
  - `api.BotSettings` — the bot's runtime tuning (delays, confidence, compare margin, retry budget, real
    input), seeded from the project's `botmaker-project.properties` on first read. Was `api.vision.ClickConfig`.
  - `api.capture.Screen` (`capture()`), `api.interaction.Mouse`/`Wait`, `api.core.Direction`,
    geometry `api.Point`/`Rect`/`Size`.
  - `api.BotMaker` — console IO. `readX()` prints a SOH-wrapped `BM-INPUT:<type>` marker to stdout
    before blocking on stdin; Studio detects/strips it to show a modal input prompt. Changing that
    marker on one side without the other breaks input prompts.
- **`com.botmaker.sdk.internal.*`** is plumbing, free to rework — and now nearly empty, because most of what
  was in it was not SDK-specific: `opencv`, `capture` (desktop backends), `launch` and the emulator transport
  all live in **shared**, where Studio can reach them too. What is left is genuinely SDK-shaped:
  - `internal/observe/IpcObserver` — it *implements* `api.observe.BotObserver` and consumes
    `MatchEvent`/`ClickEvent`/`Surface`/`Bots`; it is the adapter from SDK observer callbacks onto shared's
    already-shared telemetry wire (`shared.ipc.TelemetryClient`). Moving it would move the SDK types with it.
  - `internal/config/ProjectDefaults` — a thin typed accessor mapping shared's `ProjectProperties` (which owns
    the file, the key names and the parsing) onto `CaptureSource`/`Size`.
  (The manual harnesses that were also left behind here — `internal/Main`, `capture/CaptureTest`,
  `capture/ImageDisplay`, `capture/linux/LinuxControllerTest`, `opencv/OpencvTest` — have since been
  deleted; they were dev tools nothing referenced.)

### OpenCV / native loading

The native library is `org.openpnp:opencv` (self-contained — bundles the OS native and loads it via
`nu.pattern.OpenCV.loadLocally()`). **All loading goes through shared's single idempotent loader
`com.botmaker.shared.opencv.OpenCvNative.ensureLoaded()`.** It is invoked from a `static {}` block on the
classes that first touch an `org.opencv` type — `ImageTemplate` (which owns the image `Mat`) and shared's
`OpencvManager` — so every find/match path loads the native before any Mat is created, independent of JVM
class-link order. Do not rely on scattered per-class blocks elsewhere; a class that links an OpenCV type
without a guaranteed-loaded path is how "opencv not loaded" errors return. `ImageFinder.find` deliberately
does **not** catch `Error`s (e.g. `UnsatisfiedLinkError`), so a genuine load failure surfaces instead of
masquerading as "not found".

**The matching engines live in shared** (`shared.opencv`: `OpencvManager`, `ColorMatcher`,
`ResolutionScaler`), because Studio's Magic Wand matches at edit time exactly as a bot does at run time — and
because it collapses three independent copies of the OpenCV loader into one. They work directly on
`org.opencv.core.Mat` and return the raw `RawMatch`/`RawColorMatch` records (plain ints + score, no OpenCV
types); **mapping those onto the public `MatchResult`/`ColorMatch` is the SDK's job**, in `api.vision`. The
OpenCV `Mat` still lives in `ImageTemplate` — the old `Template`/`InternalMatch`/`MatType` wrapper layer has
been collapsed.

Because shared cannot see `api.Size`, the matcher takes the authored resolution as a `java.awt.Dimension`.
`ImageTemplate.authoredSize()` is the single conversion point; the vision call sites go through it rather
than each converting.

### Screen capture

`com.botmaker.shared.capture.ScreenCapture` is the **single** desktop-capture facade, and it now lives in
shared beside per-window capture — the platform knowledge is the same either way, and Studio's picker wants
the same grab. `api.capture.Screen`/`Desktop`/`Monitor` and every `NativeController.captureDesktop()` route
through it; there is one `getVirtualScreenBounds()` (the AWT all-monitor union). See
`../botmaker-shared/CLAUDE.md` for the backend selection (`RobotCapture` vs `SpectacleCapture`) and the
Wayland notes.

(A Swing `ImageDisplay` preview window used to live here for the `internal` dev harnesses; it went with
them. A JFrame was never something the JavaFX Studio would consume.)

### Mouse clicks & the Wayland input limitation

`api.interaction.Mouse.click` routes through `NativeControllerFactory.get()` (Windows → `Clicker`/
`User32 PostMessage`; Linux → `LinuxController` XTest, with an AWT `Robot` fallback). Match
coordinates are absolute: `ImageFinder` adds `Screen.captureOrigin()` (the virtual-screen
origin) so clicks are correct even when a monitor sits left/above the primary.

On Linux the click warps the real cursor, then restores it. **Restore is X11-only:** under native
Wayland the JVM is an **XWayland** client that can *write* the pointer (warp + click work) but
**cannot read the global cursor position** (XQueryPointer / AWT `MouseInfo` return a stale constant
when the cursor isn't over our surface — and the bot has no window). `LinuxController` therefore
skips the restore when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set, leaving the cursor on the target. The Wayland-correct
"click without disturbing the cursor" path is the xdg-desktop-portal **RemoteDesktop** (libei/
PipeWire) interface — deferred; see `ROADMAP.md`.

## Android emulator (`api.emulator`)

The emulator **capability** — the dadb transport (`AdbDevice`) and product discovery (`Platforms`,
`BlueStacks`/`LdPlayer`, `WindowsRegistry`, `EmulatorInstance`) — lives in **shared**
(`com.botmaker.shared.emulator`), because both the SDK (connect at runtime) and Studio (list instances in the
picker) need it, and so a future Studio capture-picker can preview an emulator screen. dadb therefore comes in
transitively via shared — it is **not** a direct SDK dependency.

The SDK owns only the bot-facing facade `api.emulator`: **`Emulator implements CaptureSource`** (wraps a shared
`AdbDevice`; `origin()` is `(0,0)` so a match's coords are already emulator pixels and the whole vision/click
stack works unchanged; `click(Point)` → `adb input tap`) and **`Emulators`** (static discovery over shared's
`Platforms`: `list`/`first`/`named`/`connect`, plus `use()`/`use(String)` connect-and-set-`Source` shorthands).
